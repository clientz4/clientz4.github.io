    <h1>What is my flow?</h1>
    <p>It is hard to ask myself what my flow is.
        <br>
        <br> I have never been able to maintain a interest in any specific sports, arts, music, or media for long.
        <br> Maybe that isn't a unique experience but still, it resonates with me when prompted with this question.
        <br> Having said that, there is something fascinating with the manipulation of self. With makeup, clothing,
        <br> piercings, and changing of my normal state of being, I am enraptured. Maybe it is narcissistic to stare,
        <br> fully engaged, at myself in a mirror of hours, I am truley in my flow practicing makeup, and using myself
        <br> as a large dress up doll.

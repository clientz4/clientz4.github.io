        <center>My Favorite Thing About School</center>
    </h1>

            A simple answer to what my favorite thing about school is to say my friends. At EPS I fostered connections between <br>students of different personalities, grades, and interests and I deeply value all of my relationships. I am a deeply <br>            emotional person. The honest connections that can be created through vulnerable conversation and a side-step <br>out of my comfort zone have gotten me some amazing friends and experiences here at school. In any other space <br>in my life,
            there isn't the same level of openness to connect with people in my peer group. School provides a <br>perfect opportunity of people with different backgrounds and alignments of the same age required to be under the <br>same institution. While
            saying my friends are my favorite part of school feels like a cop-out answer (because of <br>course I like my friends!), friends and peers make learning a space of comfort and growth.

            Being at school with people who have a vast amount of different interests
            <br>means that I get to experience the cool things my friends make and do.

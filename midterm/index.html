        <p style="color: #6d6875; text-indent: 30px;">Literature has been a consistent source of comfort and refuge for me as I have grown and navigated and continue to grow and navigate<br><br> an everchanging world. Back to even my earliest memories I have used words as shelters, anchors, and means
            of expression. While I never<br><br> stuck to writing, some of the hardest times of my life have been compartmentalized in line breaks and tinted paper. Stories, poems, books,<br><br> and lyrics are the lens through which I see the world.
            These words transformed from thoughts into tangible, visible books and letters<br><br> saturate my heart and mind with so much more than I could ever give back to these art forms and the authors that create within them. </p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Lake Union's story begins 14,000 years ago, when it was carved by the receding Vashon Glacier. Residing in now-occupied Duwamish land, it was originally called 'tenas chuck' in the Chinook trade jargon. In 1853, David Denny filed the first
                claim on the south end of Lake Union. Thomas Mercer, another early settler, proposed to rename the lake "Union" because he predicted that a canal would soon unite it to Lake Washington and the Puget Sound. In 1916, the water level of Lake
                Washington was lowered to the level of Lake Union so the two could be connected via the ship canal. Two years later, the construction of the Locks connected the lake to the Sound. These connections spurred an industrial boom that led to
                the proliferation of factories on the southeast shore. </p>

            <h2>Issues</h2>
            <p>Lake Union has been subjected to industrial and wastewater pollution since the industrialization of its shores. While water quality has improved substantially since the 1970's, Lake Union's ecosystem still faces environmental issues with elevated
                bacteria levels, contaminated sediment, and low oxygen levels combined with elevated salinity in the summer. Untreated sewage from houseboats and nearby homes were a main pollutant for decades. Sediment analysis in Lake Union since the
                1980's have confirmed that sediments are contaminated with toxic chemicals, especially near Gas Works and the southeast shore. Although the urbanization of Lake Union spurred economic growth in Seattle, it's important to acknowledge the
                environmental costs. Contributing to sediment cleanups and supporting projects like <a href="https://cleanlakeunion.org/current-projects/" target="_blank">Clean Lake Union</a> that filter runoff into the lake can help keep our lake healthy
                for all to enjoy. </p>

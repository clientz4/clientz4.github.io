        <h1>Top 10 Ways to Help Sustain Local Lakes</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>#1: Think before dumping</h2>
        <p>Every piece of litter makes it into the lake, in one way or another.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>#2: Seek Alternatives For Pesticides</h2>
        <p>Pesticides contaminate lake water, so instead seek out other ways to shield yourself against pests.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>#3: Use Less Fertilizer</h2>
        <p>Fertilizer is often overused, which ends up polluting lakes.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>#4: Nurture Native Plant Species</h2>
        <p>Native plants provide habitats and food for wildlife, aren’t high maintenance and are better at reducing local pollution than invasive plants.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>#5: Consider Your Cleaning Waste</h2>
        <p>Conserve water and use phosphate-free soap to maintain the health of local lakes.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>#6: Consult With Construction Workers</h2>
        <p>When building a property, try not to destroy native plants that help maintain and purify local lakes.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>#7: Develop Awareness About Your Lawn Care Services</h2>
        <p>Make sure the chemicals used by your lawn care company are minimally toxic.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>#8: Release Endangered Species</h2>
        <p>Catching and keeping endangered species will hinder their reproductive progress.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>#9: Exterminate Invasive Plants</h2>
        <p>Get rid of any invasive flora such as loosestrife that are harming the lakes’ ecosystems.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>#10: Provide Help Locally</h2>
        <p>There are many organizations that would appreciate YOUR volunteer help. Save Lake Sammamish (641-3008) hosts lake cleanup days periodically. The city of Bellevue’s Stream Team (637-5200) and King County's Surface Water Management Division (296-8361)
            continue to plant and maintain the health of native vegetation on lakes and riversides, along with preserving the actual bodies of water.</p>

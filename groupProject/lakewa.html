            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Lake Washington is the largest of the three major lakes in King County. Its steep, narrow sides were sculpted by the Vashon ice sheet, the last continental glacier to move through the Seattle area. Lake Washington was traditionally home to
                many Duwamish villages, who used canoes to access the surrounding rivers and lakes. After coal was found east of the lake, the surrounding cities began to industrialize. When the lake water levels were lowered for the construction of the
                Montlake Cut, new waterfront property was made available and homes began to line the shores. </p>

            <h2>Issues</h2>
            <p>Between 1940-1960, increasing amounts of sewage were dumped into the lake, causing widespread algae growth. In the 1970's, the city responded to biologist concerns by establishing sewage treatment plants that diverted sewage away from Lake
                Washington. Within a decade, algae levels dramatically dropped and the lake's ecosystem was stabilized. This story is often framed by King County as an environmental success; however, it came at the expense of local tribes like the Duwamish.
                When the county put their sewage plan into place, they rerouted the sewage into the Duwamish River, despite the fact that many Native Americans still relied on the river for fishing. Environmental work in Lake Washington is far from done
                - participating in efforts to reduce sewage dumping is necesarry not only to keep Lake Washington clean, but also to ensure the safety of the rivers surrounding it. </p>

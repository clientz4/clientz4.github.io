<!-- JIAXING - HOW I CHALLENGED MYSELF
I tried to challenge myself by incorporating as many elements as possible into my pages. 
I also tried to create engaging content as well. In terms of css, I ran into a lot of erros
and challenged myself to solve each and every one of them. I eventually discovered that w3 schools is
an extremely helpful resource. In terms of content, I tried to look over numerous sources to try to
find fun facts and interesting information, as I didn't want to bore views with uninteresting facts.
Creating the grid from scratch was not only my biggest challenge, but my entire group's biggest challenge.
We challenged ourselves by making a custom grid, and after some troubleshooting and teamwork, we managed to
create a functional grid. I might have challenged myself a bit too much, because I ended up adding some super
complicated code to try to make our grid look nice which ultimately didn't work. In the end, I based my grid 
off my groupmates work, so credit goes to them. (Don't worry, I understand how the grid works and how to properly
make one.)-->

            <img src="images/lakesammamishdev.gif" alt="Recession of the Puget ice lobe and the formation of Lake Sammamish" height="10%" width="100%">
            <p style="font-size: 20x;">(Above: The Recession of the Puget Ice Lobe and the Formation of Lake Sammamish)</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Lake Sammamish is a remnant of history. The Lake is located in a glacial trough that was formed during the previous ice age. Parts of the ice sheet extended South through Puget Sound, where they formed both Lake Sammamish and Lake Washington.
                Lake Sammamish was once deeper than it is now, as there is a river delta dumping sand and gravel into the lake. If the houses and infrastructure of Sammamish existed back then, they would all be underwater!
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Lake Sammamish also contains the remains of many landslides. The clay that laid below the glaciers was slippery, causing many landslides to occur. Some we so big that entire forests were dragged into the Lake! If you kayak northwest to Greenwood
                Point, you can see some trees sticking out of the water. One of the forests was submerged over a thousand years ago when a large earthquake occurred. That’s such a long time!</p>

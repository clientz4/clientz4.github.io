                <h3>History</h3>
                <img src="images/lakesammamishdev.gif" alt="Recession of the Puget ice lobe and the formation of Lake Sammamish" height="40%" width="100%">
                <p style="font-size: 15px;">Lake Sammamish is a remnant of history. The Lake is located in a glacial trough that was formed during the previous ice age. Parts of the ice sheet extended South through Puget Sound, where they formed both Lake Sammamish and Lake Washington.
                    Lake Sammamish was once deeper than it is now, as there is a river delta dumping sand and gravel into the lake. If the houses and infrastructure of Sammamish existed back then, they would all be underwater!
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 15px;">Lake Sammamish also contains the remains of many landslides. The clay that laid below the glaciers was slippery, causing many landslides to occur. Some we so big that entire forests were dragged into the Lake! If you kayak northwest to
                    Greenwood Point, you can see some trees sticking out of the water. One of the forests was submerged over a thousand years ago when a large earthquake occurred. Thatâ€™s such a long time!</p>
